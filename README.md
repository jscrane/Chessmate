# Commodore CHESSmate

An emulation of the [Commodore CHESSmate](https://commodore.international/2022/03/26/the-history-of-the-commodore-chessmate/)
based on information from [Hans Otten](http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/6530-6532/chessmate/).

Inspired by an article on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/11/14/the-quaint-history-of-the-commodore-chessmate/)!
